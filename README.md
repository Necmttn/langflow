# LangFlow Library: Coming Soon

LangFlow is a powerful library designed to assist developers in building applications that utilize large language models (LLMs). This library provides a fully typed and batteries-included solution for working with LLMs and other sources of computation or knowledge. With LangFlow, developers can create complex applications that go beyond simple LLM calls, including chains, data augmented generation, agents, and memory.

Here's what LangFlow can help you with:

- LLMs and Prompts:
  - LangFlow provides prompt management, prompt optimization, a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with LLMs.
- Chains:
  - LangFlow provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.
- Data Augmented Generation:
  - LangFlow enables specific types of chains that interact with an external datasource to fetch data to use in the generation step. This includes summarization of long pieces of text and question/answering over specific data sources.
- Agents:
  - LangFlow enables LLMs to make decisions about which actions to take, take those actions, see an observation, and repeat until done. LangFlow provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end-to-end agents.
- Memory:
  - LangFlow enables persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangFlow provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.
- State Machine:
  - LangFlow also includes a state machine that can help manage complex workflows and state transitions.

LangFlow is the ideal solution for developers who want to build powerful applications that combine the power of large language models with other sources of computation and knowledge. Stay tuned for the release of LangFlow and start building smarter, more sophisticated applications today.
